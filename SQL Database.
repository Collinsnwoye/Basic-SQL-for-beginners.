Introduction to SQL.
What is SQL?
SQL is the language used to communicate with databases. The acronym stands for Structured Query Language and is pronounced either like "sequel" or jusut SQL in letters.
Components of SQL-Based Data Systems
- Database – The top-level container that holds all data objects.
- Schema – A logical grouping of database objects like tables, views, and procedures.
- Table – A structured set of rows and columns where data is stored.
- Columns – Define the attributes or fields of a table.
- Rows – Represent individual records or entries in a table.
- Constraints – Rules that enforce data integrity (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
- Indexes – Structures that improve query performance.
- Views – Virtual tables based on SQL queries.
- Stored Procedures – Predefined SQL code that can be executed repeatedly.
